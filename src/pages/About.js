      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Web developer, passionate about technology and development, former music producer and open source contributor. I work mainly on mobile and web, but there are areas that catch my attention where I develop over time, willing to face new challenges.</p>

      <p>
        I spend time coding and creating new things, especially when they can help me or another human being in some way (see my portfolio for a list of my projects), but increasing knowledge about the entire system process and product delivery of quality at the right time, reaching the foundations of the knowledge obtained.

        In my spare time I start producing music, both for games and for electronic and techno music beats, in the meantime I research Music Computing and its audio processing. Emphasizing, I like to travel and get to know different places and cultures, live life intensely, always listening to good music and working with what I love.
